# 🔌 Teensy 4.0 Pin Expansion Shield

## Overview

This pin expansion shield was designed to make it easier to connect devices and modules to a Teensy 4.0 without the need for a breadboard.  
All Teensy 4.0 pins are routed to clearly labeled headers, and the power rails (GND, 3.3 V, and 5 V) are grouped for convenience.

This shield is intended as a **clean wiring solution for prototyping and testing**, improving organization and accessibility during hardware development.

## ⚙️ Hardware Description

The shield plugs directly onto the Teensy 4.0 headers.  
Each Teensy pin is routed to expansion connectors for easy access.

### 🔋 Power Distribution

- ⏚ **GND**  
- 🔵 **3.3 V**  
- 🔴 **5 V**

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> This shield contains no active components, no voltage regulation, and no protection circuitry.  
> It is purely a **pin breakout and power distribution board**.



## 🎯 Intended Use

- Rapid prototyping  
- Electrical testing and wiring organization  
- Laboratory setups  
- Temporary development benches  
- Easy connection to sensors, modules, and peripherals  



## 🧩 Design Notes

- Official Teensy 4.0 pinout compatibility  
- Short and direct routing  
- Clearly labeled connectors  
- Grouped power rails for convenience
