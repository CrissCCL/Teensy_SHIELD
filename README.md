# Teensy 4.0 Pin Expansion Shield


## Overview

This pin expansion shield was designed to make it easier to connect devices and modules to a Teensy 4.0 without the need for a breadboard.  
All Teensy 4.0 pins are routed to clearly labeled headers, and the power rails (GND, 3.3 V, and 5 V) are grouped for convenience.

This shield is intended as a **clean wiring solution for prototyping and testing**, improving organization and accessibility during hardware development.
